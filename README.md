## About CommonMarkSwift

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain text formatting language for writing structured documents that include formatting, hyperlinks, and media. Markdown can be used to create complex and structured documents using simple text editors and can be rendered to many different formats, although HTML is the most popular. [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) is a specification of Markdown that provides standardization for the structural and formatting rules of Markdown. CommonMarkSwift is an implementation of CommonMark for use in Swift applications on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or watchOS. CommonSwiftMark builds CommonMark's [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) reference implementation and exposes a Swift-friendly API to allow software developers to integrate and use Markdown functionality in custom applications.
